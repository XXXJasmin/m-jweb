<h2>Stanley Milgram</h2>

<h2>Solomon Asch</h2>
<p>Solomon Eliot Asch (September 14, 1907 ‚Äì February 20, 1996) was a Polish-American Gestalt psychologist and pioneer in social psychology. 
He created seminal pieces of work in impression formation, prestige suggestion, conformity, and many other topics. His work follows a common theme of Gestalt psychology that the whole is not only greater than the sum of its parts, but the nature of the whole fundamentally alters the parts.
 Asch stated: "Most social acts have to be understood in their setting, and lose meaning if isolated. 
No error in thinking about social facts is more serious than the failure to see their place and function"</p>

<h2>Jean Piaget</h2>
<p>Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development had a profound influence on psychology, especially the understanding of children's intellectual growth. His research contributed to the growth of developmental psychology, cognitive psychology, genetic epistemology, and education reform.

Albert Einstein once described Piaget's observations on children's intellectual growth and thought processes as a discovery "so simple only a genius could have thought of it."</p>
